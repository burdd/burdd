## About

### Description and Purpose

Burdd is a lightweight ticket intake + sprint board app for small teams and testing phases. End users can file public tickets (no login) and recieve a tokenized status link, while developers triage those tickets into internal issues, assign owners, add to sprints and track progress

### Inspiration

Most issues trackers separate public intake from internal planning. Burdd merges the two: a no-login ticket portal for users and a minimal sprint board for developers, so feedback moves straight from "reported" to "being fixed"

## Tech Stack

Frontend: JavaScript(Typescript), React, CSS
